        Each row in the data frame represents an activity of the current
        vehicle. The intra route ordering is therefore significant. The order of
        the routes is not significant.

        The following variables are defined per activity row.

        route (int): unique ID of the route

        subroute (int): subroute ID of the current route. Subroutes are mini
            routes between waste offloads.

        activity_id (int): the ID of the required arc visited.

        activity_type (factor): type of activity being performed, which can be
            one of the following:
                - depot_start: collection route starts at the vehicle depot.
                - collect: vehicle services the arc at the activity_id, with
                    depot and waste facilities also having unique IDs.
                - arrive_if: vehicle arrives at a facility, ready to offload
                    waste.
                - offload: vehicle offloads waste at the facility.
                - depart_if: vehicle departs the facility to resume its
                    waste collection, or return to the vehicle depot.
                - depot_end: vehicle arrives back at the depot and thereby ends
                    its collection route.

        travel_time_to_activity (int): time to travel from the PREVIOUS activity
            to the current activity, which is based on the shortest-path (time
            wise) input matrix.

        activity_time (int): time required to complete the current activity.

        activity_demand (int): amount of waste to be collected at the activity.

        remaining_capacity (int): remaining capacity of the vehicle, and which
            is reset to its maximum when waste is offloaded.

        remaining_time (int): remaining work time of the vehicle to complete its
            route.

        cum_demand (int): total demand collected by the vehicle thus far in its
            subroute.

        cum_time (int): total time spend by the vehicle thus far in its route.

        Each row in the data frame represents an activity of the current
        vehicle. The intra route ordering is therefore significant. The order of
        the routes is not significant.

        The following variables are defined per activity row.

        route (int): unique ID of the route

        subroute (int): subroute ID of the current route. Subroutes are mini
            routes between waste offloads.

        activity_id (int): the ID of the arc visited. This is different from
            the encoded solution since a unique arc ID exists for all arcs.

        arc_start_node (int): the start node of the arc visited, conforming to
            the original raw input data.

        arc_end_node (int): the end node of the arc visited, conforming to
            the original raw input data.

        activity_type (factor): type of activity being performed, which can be
            one of the following:
                - depot_start: collection route starts at the vehicle depot.
                - collect: vehicle services the arc at the activity_id, with
                    depot and waste facilities also having unique IDs.
                - traverse: vehicle travels between service, depot and offload
                    activities.
                - arrive_if: vehicle arrives at a facility, ready to offload
                    waste.
                - offload: vehicle offloads waste at the facility.
                - depart_if: vehicle departs the facility to resume its
                    waste collection, or return to the vehicle depot.
                - depot_end: vehicle arrives back at the depot and thereby ends
                    its collection route.

        total_traversal_time_to_activity (int): time to travel from the PREVIOUS
            service activity to the current service activity, which is based on
            the shortest-path (time-wise) input matrix and is the sum of all
            traverse activities between the current and previous service
            activities. Here, depot and IF visits are also considered service
            activities.

        activity_time (int): time required to complete the current activity.

        activity_demand (int): amount of waste to be collected at the activity.

        remaining_capacity (int): remaining capacity of the vehicle, and which
            is reset to its maximum when waste is offloaded.

        remaining_time (int): remaining work time of the vehicle to complete its
            route.

        cum_demand (int): total demand collected by the vehicle thus far in its
            subroute.

        cum_time (int): total time spend by the vehicle thus far in its route.

        with pandas data frames.
