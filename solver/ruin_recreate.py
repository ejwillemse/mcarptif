"""Ruin and recreate algorithm for the MCARPTIF.

This module is an implementation of the ruin and recreate metaheuristic for the 
Mixed Capacitated Arc Routing problem under Time Restrictions with Intermediate 
Facilities (MCARPITF). The module works with an existing solution, removes a 
specified set of arcs and creates new routes using the removed arcs and the 
Path-Scanning greedy-heuristic. The modified solution is returned and can then
be improved using Local Search, or more advanced single-solution based 
metaheuristics.

Algorithm steps:

    Input: Initial solution, improvement procedure, ruin-strategy, stopping
        criteria.
        
    Set the initial solution to the current solution
    Improve current solution using the improvement procedure.
    
    Update incumbent with current solution
    
    While stopping criteria has not been met:

        1. Ruin the current solution using the ruin-strategy
        2. Improve current solution using the improvement procedure.
        3. Update incumbent with current solution
        
    return incumbent solution

Note:

* Improvement procedure can be Local Search, or any single-solution based meta-
heuristic.

* Ruin-strategy can be pure-random where a random number of randomly selected
arcs are removed and included in a new solution; semi-random where a specified
number of arcs are randomly selected; or deterministic where specific arcs are
selected, optionally based on Local Search performance.

* Restart option at incumbent possible instead of always ruining the current
solution.

Solutions are represented as lists of lists of lists up-to subtrips which 
consists of arc visitation sequences INCLUDING the required depot and IF visits.

T = [[[depo1,arc1,arc2,...,IF1], [IF1,arc3,arc4,...,]]]
T = [route1, route2,...,route_K]
route1 = [subtrip1, subtrip2,...,subtrip_K]
subtrip1 = [depot, arc1, arc2,...,IF]

The module can be used as-is for the MCARP by representing it as a single route 
with subtrips, each representing the actual route, and including a dummy depot 
at the end of the last subtrip (required since MCARPTIF ends with an IF and then 
depot).

Deepcopy is used extensively since the heuristic should be able to work with 
and generate candidate solutions.

Todo:
    * Convert solutions to lists of lists [Done].
    * Add a transformation function to the MCARP.
    * Create a better unit test for recreating a solution by hard-coding a 
        solution and all it's problem info [Partially done, problem info not].
    * Create a clean implementation of path-scanning.
    * Consider the validity of returning new solution copies.
    * Consider adding unit test to check that the depot or IF arcs are not
        removed.
    * Recreate black-boxes: reduce trips, solution builders, LS
    * Fix errors in LS when an empty route is left in the solution and not
        automatically deleted.
