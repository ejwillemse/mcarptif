# Floyd-Warshall algorithm adapted for Arc to Arc with Turn Penalties

# Two options, a C version, straight out of the box, and a pytables option,
# for very large distance matrices.

# Derived from the book:
# Cormen, T., Leiserson, C., Rivest, R. (1990). Introduction to algorithms
# Chapter 26 pages 558-562.
