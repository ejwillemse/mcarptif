    Addaptation of the Floyd Warshall algorithm for computing arc to 
    arc shortest paths, instead of node to node.
    
    Required input are cost of each arc, the predecesors of an arc, 
    and the turn penalty from moving from one arc to another. Output 
    are the distance matrix D between all arcs, and the predecesor 
    matrix.
    
    Note that the graph has to be complete and connected, ie. all arcs should
    have at least one predecesor arc and one succesor arc.
    
    Output is an m x m dictionary - representing a matrix -  of distances
    and predecesors. For the predecesor matrix, a predecesor of zero means
    that the edge is the origen node.
    
    Algorithm runs in O(m^3) and uses O(m^2) space.
